üìñ ## Overview
Danny‚Äôs Diner opened in early 2021, focusing on three Japanese cuisine staples: sushi, curry, and ramen. Danny is curious about his customers' habits‚Äîwhat they enjoy, how frequently they visit, and how much they spend. The aim of this project is to extract insights to help Danny understand his customers and optimize his loyalty program. 

Through this analysis, Danny hopes to make data-driven decisions about expanding his customer loyalty program to build deeper connections and improve customer satisfaction.

üéØ ##  Problem Statement
Danny's primary goals are to:
- Understand customer visit patterns and preferences
- Track spending by each customer and identify top items
- Determine the impact of his loyalty program

The insights gathered will help Danny deliver a better experience and potentially expand the loyalty program to enhance customer engagement and retention.

 üìä ## Datasets and ER Diagram

We have three tables within the `dannys_diner` database:

1. **sales**: Customer purchases, with `order_date` and `product_id`.
2. **menu**: Menu items with `product_id`, `product_name`, and `price`.
3. **members**: Loyalty program membership data with `join_date`.

    FROM dannys_dinner.sales AS s
    INNER JOIN dannys_dinner.menu AS m
        ON s.product_id = m.product_id
    GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name
)
SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM item_rank
WHERE rank = 1;
```


### 6. First Item Purchased After Joining

           s.product_id,
           m.join_date,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS order_rank
    FROM dannys_dinner.sales AS s
    JOIN dannys_dinner.members AS m
        ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
    WHERE s.order_date > m.join_date
)
SELECT p.customer_id,
